# ParagonRels Helper Chrome Extension

I put together This quick Chrome Extension to allow you to use the arrow keys to move between photos when using a Paragon/Paragonrels website. This extension is not associated with Paragon/Paragonrels or Black Knight in any way - it just exists to add a simple feature that is currently missing (as of April 2024).
